# Astrophysicals Implementation Plan

This step-by-step plan takes the key features and tech choices you’ve outlined and breaks them into clear phases. Each phase builds on the previous ones, ensuring smooth progress from initial setup to launch and beyond.

## Phase 1: Environment & Infrastructure Setup (Weeks 1–2)

1. **Project & Cloud Accounts**
   - Create Google Cloud project and link Firebase.
   - Set up Aptos testnet account(s).
   - Reserve IPFS node or choose a hosted IPFS service.

2. **Backend Services Provisioning**
   - Enable Firestore, Authentication, Cloud Functions, Cloud Messaging, and Storage in Firebase.
   - Deploy Strapi on Google Cloud Run; configure environment variables.
   - Set up Stable Diffusion API credentials.
   - Configure Google Cloud Storage bucket for NFT CDN.

3. **Version Control & CI/CD**
   - Initialize monorepo (or separate repos) for frontend and backend.
   - Integrate GitHub (or GitLab) with CI/CD pipelines: linting, testing, and deployment hooks.

## Phase 2: Authentication & User Profile (Weeks 2–4)

1. **Firebase Authentication**
   - Implement Sign In With Apple & Google (SIWA) in Firebase Auth.
   - Build fallback for manual wallet creation with mnemonic seed phrase (client-only logic).

2. **User Data Model & Firestore Schema**
   - Define Firestore collections: `users`, `connections`, `chronicles`, `chats`, `nfts`.
   - Encrypt birth data client-side before sending to Firestore.

3. **Profile Setup APIs**
   - Cloud Functions for creating/updating user profiles.
   - Validation: birth date, time, place (with manual entry fallback for location).

## Phase 3: Connection Flow & Proximity (Weeks 4–6)

1. **QR Code Generation & Scanning**
   - Cloud Function to generate one-time QR tokens tied to User A.
   - In-app QR scanner for User B to fetch token and confirm.

2. **NFC Tap Support**
   - Implement NFC read/write on React Native (Android/iOS).
   - Fallback to QR if NFC unsupported.

3. **App Clip / Instant App Integration**
   - Configure iOS App Clip and Android Instant App for lightweight onboarding.
   - Pass QR/NFC token to full app on install; use deep links to complete connection.

4. **Proximity Confirmation**
   - After scanning/tap, call backend endpoint to verify both parties and record timestamp.

## Phase 4: Astrology Compatibility Engine (Weeks 6–8)

1. **External Astrology API Integration**
   - Create Cloud Functions to call third-party AstrologyAPI.com.
   - Parse synastry readings and compatibility scores.

2. **Future: Custom Astrology Engine**
   - Design data flow for Swiss Ephemeris + Flatlib/Kerykeion.
   - Abstract API layer so you can swap in-house engine later.

3. **Caching & Rate-Limiting**
   - Use Firebase’s in-memory cache or Cloud MemoryStore for repeated calculations.
   - Throttle requests to avoid hitting third-party limits.

## Phase 5: NFT Minting & Storage (Weeks 8–10)

1. **Metadata & Art Generation**
   - On connection, trigger Stable Diffusion API for tarot-style artwork.
   - Build metadata JSON: user IDs, date/time, compatibility score, art URL.

2. **IPFS Upload**
   - Pin metadata and image to IPFS (via Pinata or Infura).
   - Record IPFS CIDs in Firestore under `nfts` collection.

3. **Aptos Blockchain Integration**
   - Integrate Aptos JS SDK in Cloud Function or client (decide gas payer).
   - Mint NFT on Aptos testnet; store transaction hash in Firestore.
   - Prepare switch to mainnet for MVP launch.

4. **CDN Distribution**
   - Serve IPFS assets via Firebase Storage CDN for faster mobile access.
   - Implement local caching in mobile app to support offline viewing.

## Phase 6: Post-Connection Features (Weeks 10–12)

1. **Connection Chronicle Timeline**
   - Create Firestore-backed timeline entries for each connection event.
   - API endpoints: fetch chronicle by user, add custom notes or photos.

2. **In-App Chat**
   - Use Firestore real-time collections for chat threads.
   - Generate astrology-driven prompts via Cloud Function AI integration.
   - Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging to push new-message alerts.

3. **App Clip Data Transfer**
   - If User B used App Clip, merge their temporary data into permanent Firestore user record upon full install.

## Phase 7: Admin Interface & CMS (Weeks 12–14)

1. **Strapi Content Types**
   - Define roles: Admin, Moderator, Astrologer, Support.
   - Create content types: Articles, Prompts, Premium Insights, Special NFTs.

2. **Permissions & Workflow**
   - Set up role-based access control in Strapi.
   - Integrate Strapi with Firebase Auth (custom JWT verification).

3. **Deploy & Secure**
   - Deploy Strapi updates to Cloud Run.
   - Restrict Strapi Admin panel via IP whitelist or VPN if needed.

## Phase 8: QA, Testing & Security Audit (Weeks 14–16)

1. **Unit & Integration Tests**
   - Write tests for Cloud Functions, Firestore rules, NFT minting logic.
   - Frontend e2e tests covering onboarding, connection flow, chat, chronicle.

2. **Penetration & Security Review**
   - Validate Firestore security rules: only owners can read/write their data.
   - Ensure encryption of birth data in transit & at rest.
   - Audit blockchain calls and wallet interactions.

3. **Performance & Load Testing**
   - Simulate connection bursts, NFT minting spikes, chat load.
   - Tune Firestore indexes, Cloud Function memory, and Strapi autoscaling.

## Phase 9: Production Launch & Monitoring (Weeks 16–18)

1. **Switch to Aptos Mainnet**
   - Update environment variables, RPC endpoints, and gas settings.
   - Perform a dry run with limited beta users.

2. **Deploy to App Stores**
   - Finalize iOS/Android builds, App Clip/Instant App integration.
   - Submit to Apple App Store and Google Play Store.

3. **Monitoring & Alerts**
   - Set up Google Cloud Monitoring (formerly Stackdriver) for uptime, error rates.
   - Configure Firebase Crashlytics, Analytics, and performance monitoring.
   - Establish Slack/email alerts for critical issues.

## Phase 10: Ongoing Maintenance & Future Enhancements

- **Custom Astrology Engine**: Replace third-party API with in-house Swiss Ephemeris solution.
- **Bluetooth & Proximity Upgrades**: Add BLE fallback for connections.
- **Premium Features Rollout**: Subscription billing, exclusive art drops.
- **Internationalization**: Add more timezones, locale support for astrology terms.
- **User Feedback Loop**: Regular surveys, A/B testing of new chat prompts and art styles.
