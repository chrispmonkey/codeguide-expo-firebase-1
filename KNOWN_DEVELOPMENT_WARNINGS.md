# ðŸš§ Known Development Warnings

This document explains the known warnings that appear during development and why they can be safely ignored for production deployment.

## âœ… **Firebase Auth Persistence Warning** (FIXED)

### Previous Warning Message:
```
@firebase/auth: Auth (11.10.0): 
You are initializing Firebase Auth for React Native without providing
AsyncStorage. Auth state will default to memory persistence and will not
persist between sessions.
```

### **Solution Implemented:**
- âœ… **Proper Firebase Auth Configuration** - Created dedicated `firebase-auth-config.ts` module
- âœ… **React Native Persistence** - Configured `browserLocalPersistence` for React Native compatibility  
- âœ… **AsyncStorage Integration** - Explicit persistence configuration eliminates warning
- âœ… **Error Handling** - Graceful fallback for already-initialized auth instances
- âœ… **Environment Detection** - Automatic React Native environment detection

### **Files Modified:**
- `src/config/firebase-auth-config.ts` - New dedicated auth configuration module
- `src/config/firebase.ts` - Updated to use new auth config  
- `package.json` - AsyncStorage version aligned with Firebase requirements

### **Production Impact:** 
- **âœ… ENHANCED** - Proper auth state persistence in all environments
- **âœ… ENHANCED** - Better error handling and logging
- **âœ… ENHANCED** - Consistent behavior across development and production

### **Status:** âœ… **RESOLVED** - Firebase Auth persistence properly configured

## âœ… **Navigation 'Main' Screen Warning** (FIXED)

### Previous Warning Message:
```
The action 'REPLACE' with payload {"name":"Main"} was not handled by any navigator.
Do you have a screen named 'Main'?
This is a development-only warning and won't be shown in production.
```

### **Solution Implemented:**
- âœ… **Removed Manual Navigation** - Eliminated `navigation.replace('Main')` calls from auth screens
- âœ… **Automatic Routing** - Let AppNavigator handle routing based on auth state changes
- âœ… **Conditional Navigation** - Trust React Navigation's conditional rendering system
- âœ… **Enhanced Profile Check** - Added retry logic for Firebase permissions errors

### **Files Modified:**
- `src/screens/LoginScreen.tsx` - Removed manual Main navigation after auth
- `src/screens/WalletCreationScreen.tsx` - Removed manual Main navigation  
- `src/screens/WalletRecoveryScreen.tsx` - Removed manual Main navigation
- `src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx` - Enhanced automatic routing with retry logic

### **Production Impact:**
- **âœ… IMPROVED** - Seamless login flow without navigation errors
- **âœ… IMPROVED** - Automatic routing based on authentication state
- **âœ… IMPROVED** - Better error handling for permissions issues

### **Status:** âœ… **RESOLVED** - Navigation flow properly implemented
